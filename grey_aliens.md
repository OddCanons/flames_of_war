## Author's note

I enjoy a good game of [Flames of War](https://flamesofwar.com/) and I'm a hopeless science fiction gamer. "Death Rays of War" brings those two things together. Although you could use any 15mm alien miniatures with these rules, I have included silhouettes of the [Alternative Armies HOF](https://www.alternative-armies.com/collections/15mm-hof-science-fiction-range) Grey Alien miniatures as a suggestion of how to field them under these rules. They are my favorite of the 15mm options for 1940s alien invaders.

These rules envision an alternate course for the end of WWII. The "foo" fighter visitors are not content to buzz our battlefields. The major powers have Top Secret research teams dedicated to exploring the strange phenomena reported by sailors, soldiers, and pilots. The aliens spend the early and mid wars experimenting on us and the late war and beyond killing us.

The Greys are meant to represent a near unstoppable force, at least during the time period covered. The key to fun Grey games is to play with the intended force asymmetry, in particular exploring different victory conditions. The intent is for the Grey machines to be just barely vulnerable to the most powerful human guns while giving them a high likelihood of destroying their targets. For space opera fans who want more of a fair fight, there is also a list of stereotypical Warriors to aid in battles against the Greys.

This is the third draft of the unofficial force description, updated for the fourth edition of Flames of War.

## Introduction

It's late 1943. They have been watching us kill each other. Their calculating minds were going to wait for the dismantling of the vast worldwide machinery of war, but invading and harvesting a planet defended with nuclear weapons is messier. The strategic brains have reasoned that the invasion should begin at once.
   
## Greys Special Rules

The following special rules apply only to Grey forces.

### From Another Planet

#### Advanced Aliens

The Greys are not only alien in form and technology, their very thoughts are alien to the humans who encounter them. Their strange weapons, advanced technology, and tactics rattle enemy combatants. They do not doubt their ultimate victory, nor should they.
All Greys are Arrogant (2+ Motivation) Advanced (2+ Skill Test, 5+ Score to Hit).

#### Psychological Operations

The Greys are adept at undermining the confidence of their enemies. They frequently use ultrasonic and subliminal projectors to add to the effect of their strangeness and their technological superiority.

All Grey opponents add +1 to the score needed for Motivation tests.

#### Filthy Apes

The Greys disdain close contact with humans, except as part of cruel experiments.

Greys may not Assault.

Greys never Charge as part of a CounterAttack. Surviving Grey teams already within 2”/ 5cm may fight as usual. Other teams do not move.

In terms of game flavor, Greys actually prefer to Break Off from Assaults, but there are no additional rules, beyond the existing Motivation tests to force this.

### Technology

#### Unobtanium

Alien saucers and robots are clad in alloys previously unknown to human scientists. Hails of shells barely dent them.

In addition to conferring the high all-around armor protection found on most Grey units, Unobtanium confers a re-roll on all failed Armour Saves and Infantry Saves for units protected by it.

#### Death Rays

A bright beam of hissing, popping white light reaches out to incinerate flesh and steel.

When an opponent team is hit with a Death Ray weapon, Count Bail Out results as Destroyed. Passengers are automatically Destroyed (no Passenger Save) when their Vehicles are Destroyed.

#### Robots

Lumbering mechanical automatons form the back bone of any Grey invasion force, incinerating all before them with death rays. Robots are essentially walking tanks operating in teams. The methodical robot brains can manage the simple task of walking while shooting.

Grey Robot teams are treated like Very Slow Tanks that can't move At the Double.

Grey Robots do not suffer the +1 penalty for firing an ROF 1 weapon after moving.

Each Bail Out result rolled for a Robot team represents one of the Robots being disabled, cutting the Robot team’s number of weapons by one. Three cumulative Bail Out results or a Destroyed result destroys a Robot team.

Foot vehicles face tests for being Bogged Down, just like other vehicles.
 
#### Saucers

##### Hover

Invasion support saucers hover above the battlefield, ignoring all but the tallest buildings and terrain. They employ anti-gravity propulsion units to maneuver above the field of battle. Saucers are capable of flight between the Grey mother ships and ground conflicts, but are not designed for sustained flight operations at altitude, unlike their “Foo” Fighter cousins.
Rough Terrain
16”/40cm 16”/40cm 16”/40cm
Weapons that are not equipped for AA add +1 to the score to hit a Hovering Vehicle.
When a Hovering Vehicle is Bailed Out, it must pass a Skill Test or be Destroyed. If it passes the test, it is Bailed Out. A Bailed Out Vehicle with Hover has crash landed and follows the Bailed Out rules, taking to the air again when the crew Remounts. A Hovering Vehicle that crashes in Terrain must roll to avoid being Bogged Down when it crashes. Bogged Down Hovering Vehicles must free themselves before moving again, just like other vehicles.
Mobile Hover Vehicles cannot be Assaulted.
Abduction
Abductees tell horrifying stories of being strapped to metal chairs or tables and being poked and prodded in bizarre and often painful ways. Human scientists believe the abductions are part alien experiments probing for human weaknesses and part cruel sport. No one knows why the Greys release abductees, but there are two competing theories. The first theory is that the Greys are trying to spook us as part of their psychological warfare plan. The second, more sinister, theory is that the Greys are reprogramming the humans as sleeper agents to assist their invasion, when the time is right.
Abductions follow a familiar script. A Grey Saucer or Science Team gets close to one or more people. A bright light reaches out and captures the target(s). The target(s) disappear only to reappear later in some distant field, usually naked.
A team with Abduction may choose to attempt an abduction, instead of a normal Shooting or Assault attack. The team targets one Infantry team within 4”/10cm and makes a Skill roll. If they succeed, the target team is removed from the game.
    Mobility
Road
Cross-country
 Hover

 Grey Aircraft
Grey "foos," as described by human pilots, are nimble, glowing saucers that can change their vectors seemingly in violation of the laws of physics, making them difficult to target. Although often seen flying in strange formations, "foos" always attack alone. "Foos" are equipped with advanced sensors and instruments to aid in finding targets on the ground and in the air.
Don't roll for the number of Grey Aircraft. A successful Ground Attack roll always results in 1 aircraft.
Grey Aircraft add -1 to the score to range in and need a 5+ for Fighter Interception. Anti-aircraft teams add +1 to the score needed to hit Grey Aircraft.

## Captured Alien Technology

Humans are resourceful. Soldiers and scientists scavenge through the wreckage of crashed saucers and burnt out robots, looking for knowledge of Grey weaknesses and weapons that can keep humanity in the fight.

In Late-War games, like the Invasion scenario below, human forces may have the advantage of captured alien technology and soldiers with first hand experience fighting the Greys. Any Late-War force battling the Greys may include, at no additional point cost, up to two options from the list below.

### Human Death Ray Teams
We’re still trying to figure out how they work, but we know which direction to point them.
Up to one Gun Platoon with no more than four Gun teams may replace its teams’ Guns with Captured Death Rays.
OR
Replace the main gun of up to two Tanks with Captured Death Rays.
 
### Unobtanium Armour Plates
A single crashed Saucer can yield enough Unobtanium to clad several tanks.
One Tank Platoon in the company, with up to five tanks, can armor all of its Tanks in layers of Unobtanium plates. The effected Tanks gain Front and Side Armour of 10 or +1, if already 10 or higher and the Unobtanium special rule, allowing re-rolls to armour saves missed on the Front or Side Armour.
In addition, the Tanks are Overloaded and shift their Movement Special Rules as described in the table below.
Becomes
Fast Tank
(loose Fast Tank)
Slow Tank
Very Slow Tank
add Plodding (still Very Slow)
A Plodding Vehicle cannot move At the Double.

### Remote Control Robot
Military scientists have salvaged parts from one or more Grey Robots to reconstruct a functional Robot and replaced the Tactical Brain with wiring for remote control. Remote Control Robots are essentially Plodding Foot tanks with human controllers and a support/transport truck that can be used as a Recovery Vehicle, but only for human Remote Control Robot teams.
A company may include a single Captured Robot team, attached to the Company HQ Section, in addition to standard force organization allowances.
Bail Outs are treated normally. The humans run away and dive for cover, coming back to the Robot if it is still standing.
A Plodding Vehicle cannot move At the Double.
Foot vehicles face tests for being Bogged Down, just like other vehicles.
To represent a Remote Control Robot team, place a single Robot on an Infantry base with 2 human models carrying appropriate equipment, like communications gear or big wrenches.
  Original Movement Special Rule
 Light Tank
 Fast Tank
 (nothing from this list)
 Slow Tank
 Very Slow Tank

### Captured Mk1 Saucer
“I have to procure one of these for myself.” -- Captain Daniel Hilliard, USAF, saucer pilot Attach a Captured Mk1 Saucer to the Company HQ.
The only difference between a Mk1 Saucer and a Captured Mk1 Saucer is that the captured version is Unreliable. Should the Captured Saucer fail an Unreliable test, it must pass a Skill test or be Destroyed.
Alien Hunters
Many of these hardened fighters have fought the Greys before. The others have been trained in specific Grey fighting tactics. Their minds are prepared and they know where to hit the alien machines.
Any one Platoon is immune to Psychological Operations and gains the Anti- Unobtanium special rule. Grey teams and vehicles do not get the benefit of the Unobtanium re-roll when hit by this Platoon.

## Scenarios

There is a Campaign section following the scenarios. It provides a fair narrative structure for two players to try out these rules and to play the scenarios, even if the rules and individual scenarios are still unbalanced.

## Close Encounter (Early or Mid War)
The Grey scientists have been probing humanity for weaknesses, conducting experiments to find ways to speed the success of an invasion. This early or mid war scenario portrays an encounter with a small Grey “Science” party.
Close Encounter uses the Night Fighting, Delayed Reserves, Scattered Reserves, and Prepared Positions special rules.
Grey Forces (Attacker)
• (2iC) Science Team
• Mk 2 Science Saucer
Your force is has been looking for an Infantry Platoon on which to conduct experiments. During a night expedition, you spotted a Platoon separated from the rest of its Company.
You must Abduct all of the initial Infantry teams, before the rest of the Company arrives and drives you away.
Greys are not effected by the Night Fighting rules. Use of the Abduction Ability counts as shooting for purposes of visibility.
 
 Human Forces (Defender)
You may field any legal 600 point force from any nation, provided the force includes at least one Infantry Platoon. Your forces are stretched thin on this part of the map. They have made camp for the night.
Preparation
1. The defender deploys an Infantry Platoon in the area marked in the center of the table. They are in Prepared Positions.
2. The rest of the defender’s Platoons are held in Reserve.
3. The attacker deploys in the corner as marked.
Beginning the Battle
1. The attacker has the first turn.
2. The defender’s initial Infantry Platoon is not Destroyed in the event of a failed Morale
Check, they are only Pinned Down. They may not leave the table, except through Abduction.
Ending the Battle
The battle ends when either:
• all of the initially deployed Infantry teams have been abducted
• the 2iC Science team is Destroyed
• the Mk2 Science Saucer is Destroyed
• the Mk2 Science Saucer is hit by one of the Reserve teams using a weapon with Anti-
tank 10 or better, regardless of the effect of the hit (the Greys bug out as the Reserves close in)
Who Won?
The attacker wins if he successfully abducts all of the Infantry teams from the de- fender’s initial Infantry Platoon. The defender wins if at least one of those initial Infantry teams is still around at the end.

 It's a Barrage Balloon (Early or Mid War)
Human pilots managed to shoot down a Grey saucer. It crash landed on a farm near a small town. As both sides race to secure the crash site, their intelligence offices prepare the same cover story, “an experimental barrage balloon crashed in a field.” As opposing sides approach they find out there were survivors. Why do these things always happen at night?
It’s a Barrage Balloon uses the Night Fighting, Fair Fight, Mobile Battle, and Reserves special rules.
Attacker Force
You have a 600 point force. Secure the crashed alien saucer, preferably intact.
Defender Force
You have a 600 point force. Secure the crashed alien saucer, preferably intact.
“Neutral” Grey Forces
• Death Ray Team
• Bogged Down Mk1 Saucer
Preparation
1. In addition to the typical farmland and woods terrain on the table, place the crashed Bogged Down Mk1 Saucer objective and a farm building, as shown. There is a Grey Death Ray team in the building, conferring the usual Bulletproof Cover Save. The Saucer cannot free itself and will remain Bogged Down (can’t move, can’t fight, etc.) until it is captured or Destroyed.
2. Both players roll a die. The player with the higher score chooses a deployment zone and is the attacker. The other player is the defender and deploys on the opposite table edge.
 
 3. The attacker places one Platoon. The the defender places one Platoon. The rest of the Platoons are held in Reserve.
Beginning the Battle
1. The attacker has the first turn.
2. During each player’s shooting step, he may shoot with the Death Ray team. This
means the Death Ray team is taking double turns until someone manages to Destroy them. The Death Ray team can only shoot, respond to Charges with Defensive fire, and Attack as part of a Counterattack.
3. If the Saucer is Destroyed by either side, leave it on the table. It can still be captured, it’s just not worth as much.
Ending the Battle
The battle ends when both:
• the Death Ray team is Destroyed
• either player starts their turn holding the Saucer
Who Won?
The player who captured the Saucer wins. It is only a partial victory if the Saucer was Destroyed.

 The Earth Stands Still (Mid War)
It's November 7th, 1943, the day the "foo" researchers dreaded. A single alien saucer lands in the capital of every major nation. Out of each saucer march six alien robots. The lead robot demands cessation of hostilities and total capitulation. A few nations surrender, but most respond with force. The Greys are trying to capture key civilian leaders to use as brainwashed spokesmen to pacify the masses of each nation. The human forces have detected building radio transmission that appear to be part of the invasion plan. In addition to protecting their civilian leaders the human forces want to knock out those transmitters.
The Earth Stands Still uses the Not One Step Back Street-Fighting Mission from the Flames of War (2 ed) book.
Grey Forces
• Heavy Platoon with 1 Robot Squad • Mk 1 Saucer
• Priority Air Support
Human Forces
The human player assembles a 1500 point force.
Standard Mission
The players play the Not One Step Back Mission with the following small adjustments:
• The Grey player is always the attacker
• The attacker’s deployment zone should be part of a central square or park, the kind of
obvious central mall at the heart of a capital that has room for a saucer and some big
Robots
• The attacker keeps no units in Reserve

 Last Hope (Late War)
Human scientists have been studying recovered Greys and Grey technology. They believe they have found a weakness that they can exploit in a super weapon that will turn back the tide of invasion. The Greys have uncovered the plan and dispatched a force to destroy the lab complex where they believe the human scientists are assembling the weapon.
The alien spearhead is closing in on the decoy lab. The defenders are trying to buy time for the scientists in the real lab to complete their work. Human life is becoming far to precious to throw away in a last stand for a decoy, but the leaders do hope to slow down the Greys enough to keep them from discovering the secret until it is too late.
If only we had listened to Grote Reber.
Last Hope uses Fighting Withdrawal Mission from the Flames of War (2 ed) book and the Reserves special rule.
Grey Forces
Any legal Alien Invasion Force worth up to 2000 points
Human Forces
Any legal 2000 point force
Standard Mission
The players play the Fighting Withdrawal Mission with the following small adjustments:
• The Grey player is always the attacker
• The attacker places two Platoons at the beginning and keeps the rest in Reserve
• The table is setup with the attacker coming in on a short edge, as shown
• The objectives are placed as shown, instead of the players placing them
• The defender can choose any remaining objective to remove when it is time to remove
an objective
 
 Campaign
The scenarios above can be played as an episodic invasion campaign. The campaign structure serves to even out the challenge for the two players, even if the Greys’ abilities, points values, and the scenarios are not yet balanced. Start with two people and add a third for the final scenario. Players 1 and 2 may be any nations, but each player must be the same nation throughout the campaign. Players may choose completely different forces from scenario to scenario, provided each force is compatible with the time period and scenario and campaign rules.

 Captured Alien Technology Table

 After each battle, if a player has notched a victory, consult the Captured Alien Technology Table, marking the box for his hard won prize. These are the Captured Alien Technology advantages available to each player in the last battle. The player who wins the last battle wins the Campaign.
The last battle should be modified as follows to support the Campaign:
• The Greys build a 2500 point force
• P1 and P2 build 1500 point forces
• P1 and P2 are allied against the Greys and treat their forces as one for all game
purposes
• P1 and P2 take their turn together
• P1 and P2 alternate being Lead Player for a turn, starting with the player who won It’s
a Barrage Balloon
• The Lead Player takes all of his actions first in each step
• If the defenders win the mission, the campaign winner is determined by adding up
each player’s points from the table below and subtracting the number of Platoons he lost, up to four. Example: A player Destroys 2 Robot teams, 1 Mk1 Saucer, and 3 Death Ray teams (11 points) and the Greys Destroy 6 of his Platoons, he earns 7 points, 11 - 4.
• P3 wins if the Greys capture an objective, but P1 and P2 still determine relative position as described above

 Archetypal Warriors
Players using the Grey rules, can take advantage of the Warriors listed below in addition to the Warriors already available. Players should agree ahead of time on whether or not to allow these Warriors in their Grey games. They may significantly change the tone and balance of your games. They have undergone less play testing (if any) than the rest of the rules.
Dr. Zboden
The crazy Russian scientist is famous for his “bottled lightning” experiments with elec- tricity. He has recently outfitted a Russian Platoon with shells that unleash horrific elec- trical energies in addition to their normal damage.
Characteristics
Dr. Zdoben is an Infantry team and a Warrior. He can be attached to any Rus- sian Gun or Artillery Platoon for 70 points.
Lanz von Liebenfels
Special Rules
Lightning Shells: When any Gun team in Dr. Zboden’s Platoon hits an enemy team, roll a die and add the value to the Anti-tank value for that hit. Role a sepa- rate die for each hit. The firepower of the hit is 3+, unless it was already 2+ or 1+.
Lanz von Liebenfels is an Aryan mystic and a powerful Thule sorcerer. Although shunned by Hitler in public to hide his importance, von Liebenfels is the Reich’s fore- most mystic and expert on Thule magic.
Characteristics
Lanz von Liebenfels is an Infantry Com- mand team and a Warrior. von Liebenfels can replace any German 2iC team for +50 points.
Special Rules
Sidereal Pendulum: Instead of shooting, von Liebenfels may reveal any one en- emy platoon anywhere on the table.
Projection: von Liebenfels taps Thule energy to unleash a blast of techno- magic power at the enemy. He has Range 8”/20cm, ROF 2, Anti-tank 10, and Firepower 4+.
Oratory and Sophistry: Teams in von Liebenfels’ Platoon add -1 to their score needed for Motivation tests.

 Warrior One
Joe Nelson was a researcher working on the Manhattan Project when he received what should have been a lethal dose of radiation from an accident during a critical mass ex- periment. Even as Nelson grew stronger, he began to produce increasing levels of ra- diation, occasionally emitting directional bursts. After the deaths of many doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff, Nelson was transferred to the Project 1943 labs.
The Project 1943 scientists built for Nelson first a lead room, then an Unobtanium room, then a series of Unobtanium armour suits, all of the Unobtanium coming from a crashed Grey saucer. Nelson now wears the first Warrior class suit. In addition to protecting those around him from radiation, the Warrior suit provides him with unearthly protection and helps him focus his radiation bursts into monstrous beams of radiation. Although he is merely remarkable in an Assault and has only typical speed, Warrior One is a potent force on any battle field.
Characteristics
Warrior One is a Warrior and an Inde- pendent. Warrior One can be attached to any American Company for __ points.
Warrior One is a Fearless Veteran.
He has Range 16”/40cm, ROF 2 whether he moves or not, Anti-tank 14, and Fire- power 3+.
Special Rules
Unobtanium Armour: Warrior One makes all Infantry Saves on 2+, re-rolling failed saves. All Firepower tests involving Warrior One are taken at 6. Warrior One gets a (re-rollable) Infantry Save when hit in Assault.

### il Professore

Il Professore is an enigmatic character who frequently appears when Earth, Italy in particular, is under alien attack. Il Professore and his friends always seem to know more about the menace than the military people around them.

Characteristics
il Professore is an Infantry Team, a War- rior, and an Independent. He can be at- tached to any non-German Company for 350 points.
Il Professore is a Fearless Veteran. He cannot shoot and never attacks in an As- sautl.
Special Rules
Time Loop: Once per game, your oppo-
nent skips a turn.
Lore: If il Professore is within 2”/10cm of a friendly team, that team may roll 2 dice and add the results when they would roll a single die.
Lucky Immortal: Il Professore can never be Destroyed. If he would be destroyed, he is Pinned Down instead.

### Splendiferous Man
Born on another planet, sent to Earth by his parents before the Greys destroyed his home world, and secretly adopted and raised by the 9th Earl of Shaftesbury and his wife, the 10th Earl of Shaftesbury has adopted the alter ego Splendiferous Man. Given super powers by the cosmic rays that bombarded his infant body on the journey to Earth, he has chosen to use his might to help others. From his Tower of Serenity on the shores of Lough Neagh, Splendiferous Man ventures out to take the fight to the Greys.
Shaftesbury avoided the military service expected of a man of his age and status by feigning a case of exotic jungle fever. Free to change into his tights and cape at will, Splendiferous Man spends most of his time thinking about the best ways to help against the Germans. The arrival of the Greys has spurred him into real action.
Characteristics
Splendiferous Man is an Infantry team, a Warrior, and an Independent. Splendifer- ous Man can join any British Company for 420 points.
Special Rules
Flight/Super Speed: Splendiferous Man uses his powers to appear to be all over the field. When you move Splendiferous Man, pick him up and place him any- where on the table, ignoring all move- ment rules.
X-Vision: Splendiferous Man has Line of Sight to all teams on the table.
Super Strength: When Splendiferous Man attacks or counterattacks in an As- sault, he automatically Destroys the team he attacks. He can choose to destroy two teams by throwing the first at another within 4”/10cm.
Invulnerable: Splendiferous Man auto- matically passes all Infantry and Fire- power saves.
Invincible: Splendiferous Man automati- cally passes all Morale and Skill checks.
Secret Identity: Splendiferous Man tries to hide his secret identity. Embarrassed shouts of, “Shaftesbury!” or, “Anthony?” from officer friends are a constant danger. Each time Splendiferous Man moves to within 12”/30cm of any Command team or a Command team moves to within 12”/ 60cm of him, roll a die. On a roll of 3+ remove Splendiferous Man from the game. He counts as Destroyed.
Splendiferanium: Your opponent selects one enemy team that is carrying this alien metal. While Splendiferous Man is within 12” /60cm of this team, he loses all of his Special Rules except Secret Identity.

### Harry S. Truman

As the Greys close in on the last intact military installations, every man finds his purpose, “I’m an artillery officer, Alben. I belong on that field.”

#### Characteristics

Harry Truman is a Warrior. Truman can replace the Command team of any Late War American Gun or Artillery Platoon for +40 points.

#### Special Rules

**Give ‘em Hell:** Harry’s Platoon is Fearless Veteran.

**Destiny:** Each turn, you may select up to three dice to be rolled by Harry’s Platoon and one die to be rolled for an enemy team in response to an action by Harry’s Platoon. You place these dice on the table, choosing any value you desire, instead of rolling them. All other rules still apply, you are simply determining the value of the rolls instead of rolling the dice.

## Alternate Aliens

_This version of the alien invaders is intended for those who think grey aliens are too silly._

_Their_ von Neuman probe detected the first faint artificial radio transmissions from the system as the probe completed its long breaking impulse. The probe spent two silent decades maneuvering into a solar orbit near the resource rich environment of the system’s primary asteroid belt. It continued to monitor the slowly growing transmissions from the third planet, learning to translate them, as it built the first machines it would use to **convert** the system. In addition to the conversion machines template, the probe retrieved neutralization templates from its design library, starting with space tractors and mass displacement drives.

### Scenario: Alien Invasion (Late-War)

#### Attacker Forces

- Asteroid bombardment
- Nano-cybernetic bacteria
- Clanking replicators

#### Defender Forces

The defender sets up any force they want, literally, up to any point cost, literally. They may ignore force organization restrictions and mix forces from different countries and sides of the war.

#### Preparation

- The defender sets up their forces anywhere they want.
- The attacker holds all forces in reserve.

#### Beginning the Game

- The attacker begins with an asteroid bombardment, Destroying all teams on the table and any teams the defender has in reserve.

#### Ending the Game

The game ends after the attacker’s first turn.

#### Who Won?

The attacker wins.
